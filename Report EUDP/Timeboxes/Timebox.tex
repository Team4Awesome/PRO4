\chapter{Timeboxes}
Of cause all teammembers will help eachother and discuss the different elements throughout the project, but the members of the team must choose a topic to specialize in. Below a short description is made to divide the members into groups of specialization, acting as guidelines for who is in charge of the development in the different areas:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Morten - Software} in charge of C/C++ and Linux programming, in cooperation with Henrik.
\item \textbf{Henrik - Software specialization} with most experience in C/C++ algorithms be cooperating with Morten.
\item \textbf{Jacob - DSP and Analog specialization} will be in charge of the DSP and Analog area, in cooperation with Anders.
\item \textbf{Anders - FPGA and DSP specialization} will cooperate together with Jacob in implementing and computing the elements containing DSP, Analog technique and FPGA design.
\end{itemize}
This is just as guidelines, everyone will of cause have knowledge about the elements the other team members are developing.
