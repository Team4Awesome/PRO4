\chapter{requirements}
Below all the requirements are listed. They are divided into four major categories; Functional, non-functional, behavioural and performance requirements. They are derived from our customer needs / customer requirements.\\
They are further divided into smaller groups, describing the category, could be safety, environmental etc.. First Below there is an example of how requirements are referred to throughout this report:\\
