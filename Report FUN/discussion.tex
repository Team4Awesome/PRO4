\chapter{Discussion}
Below a discussion regarding two sun-tracking methods will take place. Pros and Cons for each method in a shorter summary and then a full discussion regarding the choice of the sun tracking method:\\


\textbf{Sun Tracking Method: Sun Sensor}\\

\begin{tabular}{|p{7cm}|p{7cm}|}
\hline Pros & Cons\\ 

\hline 
\begin{itemize}
\item More precise
\item Can adjust itself to the various actions that might occur to the position of the sun versus the position of the earth
\item The Sensor can be used as a call to start up the solar panel instead of a fixed time for the panel to start up
\item Considers variables
\item Measure sun intensity
\end{itemize}

& 
\begin{itemize}
\item More expensive
\item More complex to code
\item “Hard” to avoid disturbances
\item Sensor blockade
\item Breakable
\item Limited lifetime
\item High Maintenance 
\end{itemize}
  \\

\end{tabular} 

\subsection{Sun Tracking Method: Look-up Data table}
\begin{tabular}{|p{8cm}|p{8cm}|}
\hline Pros & Cons\\ 

\hline 
\begin{itemize}
\item Easy to implement.
\item Low cost.
\item No disturbances from environment.
\item Easy to update.
\item Low maintenance.
\end{itemize}

& 
\begin{itemize}
\item Limited lifetime
\item Not entirely precise
\end{itemize}
  \\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular} 

The sun sensor will be able to keep a precise tracking system for a solar panel because it can adjust to the sun at most times, where the only exceptions are when something is blocking the sensor etc. a cloud, a car or a person. While a look-up data table will have fixed values for the position that it has to be in thus keeping a better tracking system when the sun is hidden behind a cloud, while if for example on a day with the sun never hidden by a cloud and with no one to interact and causing trouble for the sun tracker, then the sun sensor will keep a more precise tracking while the data table might have tiny flaws in the position of where the solar panel have to be.  Financial-wise the sun sensor will be the more expensive choice, because of the start price of the sensor and because the sensor is physical hardcore that might break if contact between another hard object is achieved, while the data look-up table is entirely software and can only be harmed if the software gets infected by a virus which is considered to have a much lower chance of happening compared to a physical blow to the equipment.  Speaking in terms of maintenance, the sensor will need to be cleaned in order to have a clear vision of the sun, and the sensor will need help if something is blocking the sensor, while the data look-up table’s worst case of maintenance is when a new data table will be required, the software will then automatically download a new look up table and continue to track the sun as good as the software is programmed, this will be completed automatically through the web server. To sum it up, the sensor will be better overall as a tracking method but the budget for the smaller improvement in sun tracker is not worth the higher difference in budget.
